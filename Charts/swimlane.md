### Swimlane Flowchart


- Customer Initiates Order
- Customer selects products and places an order through the e-shop website
- The e-shop website receives the order and processes payment. The order details are then forwarded to customer service for fulfillment
- Customer service receives the order details and prepares the items for shipping. This includes packaging and preparing the order for dispatch.
- The packaged order is handed over to the delivery service. The delivery service then ships the order to the customer's address.
- The customer receives the order. They are prompted, either via email or through the e-shop platform, to review the order or report any issues.
- If the customer is satisfied, they may leave a positive review or no action is taken, concluding the process.
- If there are issues (e.g., damaged items, incorrect products), the customer can initiate a complaint. This starts another process focused on customer complaints and resolution (crucial for customer satisfaction and quality control)
